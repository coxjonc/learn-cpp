Arrays aren't always as efficient as linked lists

Memory manager is tasked with allocating memory

Address of a block of memory is the address of the first byte

Irrespective of the size of an array, the application can access any of the elements of the array in constant time

Can't really extend an array after it's declared.

In a linked list, instead of asking for a block of memory, you request one block at a time.
